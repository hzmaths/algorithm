	abstract = "FLOPC++ is an open source algebraic modeling language implemented as a C++ class library. It allows linear optimization problems to be modeled in a declarative style, similar to algebraic modeling languages, such as GAMS and AMPL, within a C++ program. The project is part of COmputational INfrastructure for Operations Research (COIN-OR) and uses its Open Solver Interface (OSI) to achieve solver independence."
